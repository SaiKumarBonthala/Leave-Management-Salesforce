## Project Overview
The Salesforce Leave Management System is a Lightning Web Components (LWC) based application designed to streamline the process of employee leave requests and managerial approvals. The system centralizes leave data management, automates workflows, and presents users with intuitive interfaces to apply for leave, track pending approvals, and review leave history.

- Manager dashboard to review, approve, or reject leave requests from their team members.
- Dynamic user interfaces built with Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) for responsive and accessible UI.
- Apex backend integration for role-based data fetching and processing.
- Validation rules ensuring data integrity for leave requests.
- Automated status tracking with color-coded visual indicators.
- Reporting and dashboards for Leave statistics and user activity.
- Security implementation with sharing rules and field-level security.
